Hey everyone! 
This is my Task 1 for the Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

About the Task

The goal of this task was to build a fixed navigation bar that:
Stays at the top of the page while scrolling
Changes background color when scrolling
Highlights menu items on hover
Even though it sounds simple, I really enjoyed implementing these interactive UI elements.

What I Learned

How to detect scroll events using JavaScript
Adding smooth hover transitions with CSS
Structuring a clean and fixed navigation bar
Making web interfaces more dynamic and user-friendly

Technologies Used

HTML – Page structure
CSS – Styling and animations
JavaScript – Scroll-based interactivity

Personal Note

This task helped me understand how small front-end features can really improve the user experience. It was fun building this and I’m excited to keep learning more throughout this internship.

Thanks,
Sravya Challa
